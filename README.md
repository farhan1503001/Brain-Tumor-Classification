# Brain-Tumor-Classification
InceptionV3 model has been used using the concept of transfer learning to classify brain tumors from MRI images of figshare dataset.
Here our model based on InceptionV3 achieved about 99.4% accuracy on validation set and outperformed all other previous peers on the same figshare CE-MRI dataset.
Proposed model also performed quite better with regards to other performance metrices such as Precision, Recall, Specificity, F-1 Score than previous methods.
